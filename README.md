# TravelJournal_React

**About ℹ️**

A travel journal was created to practice ReactJS. It includes descriptions of places I have visited and future adventures. Journal Entries contain Title, Location, Google Maps Link, Start Date, End Date, Description, and Image. Journal Entries are created dynamically using the .map() method and props on the data.js file, an array of objects. While creating this project, I learned about React Props, Creating Components from an Array, using Mapping Components, etc.
